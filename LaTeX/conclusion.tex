\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We have presented a new interactive system for animating sketch drawings using video examples. The key idea is to extract object motion presented in the video using sparse point tracking, and transfer it to the sketch image using controlled mesh deformation. For motion extraction, we propose a new tracking method that is robust against occlusion and ambiguity, and further combines it with easy user controls for reliable tracking. For motion transfer, our system allows the user to fine control the animation using a set of interactive tools.  
We conduct a user study to evaluate the usability of the system for both novice and artist users. 

We believe our current work has only scratched the surface of an exciting opportunity. As pointed out earlier, our system still has problems for handling smooth image regions such as deforming clouds, or stochastic motions such as ocean waves.  Expanding the system to handle more types of objects is always desirable. The system currently can only transfer the raw motion extracted from video, it would be interesting to combine it with previous motion stylization or exaggeration approaches, such as the Animation Filter~\cite{Wang:2006} to create even more convincing animation. We also plan to build a large motion library using our system on a large video corpus, so that motion can be automatically transferred to animate an entire drawing that contains multiple objects.
