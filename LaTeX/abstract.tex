Sketch animation is a popular art form for depicting object motion in a drawing-in-time way. 
%capturing the living qualities of natural phenomena. 
Creating such animation using traditional tools requires special artistic skills, and is tedious to produce even for trained professionals. In this paper, we propose a new system that can help users create sketch animation more efficiently by transferring motion of real objects in videos to static sketch drawings, through an interactive process. 
By directly transferring object motion from video instead of creating motion by hand,  our system significantly lowers the barrier for creating animations for novice users.  
Our system addresses a few major technical challenges in this new workflow, such as \ca{namely? including?} motion extraction from video, video-to-sketch alignment, and motion-driven sketch animation. While each of the sub-problems \ca{could be (is?)} difficult to solve fully automatically, we present reliable solutions by combining new computational algorithms with intuitive user interactions.
